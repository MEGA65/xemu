This directory is used to build result binaries.

This directory must exist for the build process!

Symbolic link to the directory '../../rom' here is used to be able to
run the emulator from the source tree without preliminary install, since
emulators also search for $(BINARY_PATH)/rom/... for its rom or data files.
