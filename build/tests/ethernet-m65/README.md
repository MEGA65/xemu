This sub-project has been moved to here: https://github.com/lgblgblgb/mega65-utils/tree/master/eth-tool

Testing ethernet emulation of Xemu/Mega65. This piece of code should run on
a real M65 as well. It does ARP reply, ICMP echo request reply (ping), custom
UDP based "monitor port", TFTP server and DHCP client. The status of the project
can be checked on the link above, though.
