PRELIMINARY tries for custom "loader" of emscripten compiled version of Xemu emulators.

I am trying to start with emscripten's generated html / js "boot" code, to provide
something which can be embedded into any page more easily and probably in a custom way.

Future plans: provide interface to interact with the emulator from outside JS code,
ie custom buttons, messages (debugger on the page?), whatever ...
